Notes:
- Edit loan_schemes.csv to add your own schemes. Keep columns:
  scheme_id,scheme_name,purpose_tags,eligibility_income_min_monthly,eligibility_income_max_monthly,loan_amount_min,loan_amount_max,tenure_min_months,tenure_max_months,interest_rate_annual_percent,notes
- The demo uses simple rule-based filtering. After approval we can add NLP, embeddings, user history and a better ranking algorithm.
